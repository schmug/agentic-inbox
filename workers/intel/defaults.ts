 * Default threat-intel feeds shipped with the project.
 *
 * Each feed is a newline-delimited list of domains or URLs. The refresh
 * worker tolerates comments (lines starting with `#`) and blank lines.
 *
 * Licensing notes for redistribution:
 * - URLhaus is public-domain (CC0) — safe to mirror.
 * - PhishTank requires an API key + attribution — ship as opt-in config only.
 * - PhishDestroy / DestroyList publish plain text feeds; check their current
 *   terms before redistributing aggregated copies from the hub.
 * Consumers are free to add their own feeds via mailbox settings.
