/**
 * Async yaramail sidecar enrichment signal (issue #256).
 *
 * The sidecar is an operator-supplied Python container that receives
 * attachment references from PhishSOC, runs yaramail-powered scanning
 * (PDF extraction, password-protected ZIPs, nested archives, .eml recursion),
 * and POSTs YARA match results back to a callback route.
 *
 * This module handles the outbound side only:
 *   - `computeYaraScoreDelta` normalises raw YARA match lists to a bounded
 *     score contribution (capped at YARA_SCORE_CAP = 30).
 *   - `fireYaraScan` fires the fire-and-forget enrichment request via
 *     ctx.waitUntil when the mailbox has the scanner enabled.
 *
 * Wiring `fireYaraScan` into the email-receive pipeline, the callback route
 * that accepts sidecar responses, and the DO methods for storing results are
 * tracked in the follow-up issue filed against #256.
