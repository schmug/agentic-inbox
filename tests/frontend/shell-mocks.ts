// Shared factories for the queries `Shell` (`app/components/phishsoc/Shell.tsx`)
// consumes. Any test that renders Shell — directly or via a route element —
// must mock every one of these so the render doesn't fan out to the real
// fetcher. Today Shell calls `useMailbox`, `useMailboxes` (from
// `~/queries/mailboxes`), `useDashboardSummary` (from `~/queries/dashboard`),
// and `useDomainStats` (from `~/queries/domains`).
//
// **Adding a new query to Shell?** Update the matching factory below — every
// test that calls the factory in its `vi.mock(...)` body picks up the new
// export automatically. This was the gap that bit us in the May 2 sweep:
// PR #143 added `useDomainStats` to Shell, and PR #145 (developed in
// parallel) had to be patched after rebase because its `home.test.tsx` and
// `domains-list.test.tsx` mocked `~/queries/domains` without exposing the
// new hook.
//
// Usage:
//
//   vi.mock("~/queries/mailboxes", () => shellMailboxesMock());
//   vi.mock("~/queries/dashboard", () => shellDashboardMock());
//   vi.mock("~/queries/domains", () => shellDomainsMock({
//     // Per-test override — the route under test exercises this hook with
//     // varying state, so let the test thread the mutable closure in.
//     useDomainStats: () => ({ ...queryState, refetch }),
//   }));
//
// Each factory accepts an `overrides` object so individual tests can swap in
// per-case behavior (e.g. `home.test.tsx` varies `useDomains` per test) while
// keeping the Shell-baseline defaults for everything else.
