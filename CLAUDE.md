# CLAUDE.md

This file is loaded into Claude Code sessions working on this repo. It captures
conventions surfaced by real incidents so future agents inherit the lesson
without re-discovering it. Keep entries grounded in observed events; this is a
seed, not a comprehensive style guide.

## Conventions

### URL host checks in test mocks must parse, not substring

When a test routes mock `fetch` responses by URL, do **not** match with
`url.startsWith("https://example.com")` or `url.includes("example.com")`.
CodeQL's `js/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization` rule (high severity) flags
those patterns as an SSRF / redirect-bypass risk even in test-only code, and
PRs are gated on CodeQL — the alert blocks merge.

Parse the URL and compare the parsed `hostname` instead:

```ts
// BAD
if (url.startsWith("https://cti.api.crowdsec.net")) { ... }

// GOOD
if (new URL(url).hostname === "cti.api.crowdsec.net") { ... }

// GOOD (host + path)
const u = new URL(url);
if (u.hostname === "cti.api.crowdsec.net" && u.pathname.startsWith("/v2/smoke/")) {
  ...
}
```

This applies to both mock dispatchers (deciding which canned response to
return) and assertions (`expect(call[0]).startsWith(...)` → use the parsed
equivalent).

Origin: PR #130 (CrowdSec CTI deep-scan) — five test-only URL substring checks
tripped CodeQL and required a fixup commit.

### Don't race a SECURITY_SPEC.md update against a parallel doc PR

`SECURITY_SPEC.md` codifies invariants the security pipeline enforces. When a
code change narrows or extends one of those invariants, the spec needs to
follow — but if both the code change and a separate spec-document PR are open
at the same time, editing the spec from inside the code PR guarantees a merge
conflict on whichever lands second.

Instead:

1. Land the code change first with the new behavior.
2. In that PR's body, note: `follows up: narrow SECURITY_SPEC.md Rule N once
   #<spec-PR-num> lands.`
3. After both predecessors are on `main`, file a small `docs:` PR doing the
   narrowing.

Origin: PR #132 (Closes #28) changed Rule 5's timeout-vs-parse-fail behavior,
deferred the spec edit to avoid racing PR #119 (which introduced the spec),
and PR #134 narrowed the rule once both had landed.

### `stripDefaultEqual` runs on every settings-tier write

Every endpoint that writes a settings tier — mailbox POST, mailbox PUT,
domain PUT, org PUT — must route the parsed payload through
`stripDefaultEqual(...)` from `workers/lib/mailbox-settings.ts` before
`BUCKET.put`. If you add a new tier or a new write endpoint targeting
`mailboxes/<id>.json`, `domains/<domain>.json`, or `org/settings.json`,
the strip pass is part of the contract — not optional.

```ts
// GOOD — every settings-tier write
const parsed = SomeSettings.safeParse(body?.settings ?? {});
if (!parsed.success) return c.json({ error: "..." }, 400);
const stripped = stripDefaultEqual(parsed.data);
await env.BUCKET.put(key, JSON.stringify(stripped));
```

Without it, a fresh form save with rendered defaults
(`agentModel: DEFAULT_AGENT_MODEL`, `autoDraft: { enabled: true }`)
persists those values as explicit overrides at the written tier,
silently shadowing every upstream tier forever — which defeats
absent-key-inherits semantics for the most common write path.

Origin: #106 acceptance criterion 6 originally read "PUT" only. PR #148
shipped with the strip on mailbox PUT but not on mailbox POST — caught
by advisor before merge and fixed in the same PR. PR #154 shipped with
the strip on mailbox POST/PUT but not on the new domain PUT — same
advisor catch, fixed before merge. The pattern is symmetric across
tiers; the rule is "every write," not "every PUT."

### Stacked PRs: `--delete-branch` on the predecessor auto-closes the dependent

This repo merges with `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` (the
convention every recent commit on `main` follows). When PR B is stacked
on PR A (B's `baseRefName` points at A's branch, not `main`), merging A
with `--delete-branch` deletes A's branch on the remote — and GitHub
auto-closes any open PR whose base branch was just deleted. PR B goes
to `state: CLOSED` even though its content is fine, and `gh pr reopen`
fails (`Could not open the pull request`).

Two ways to avoid it:

1. **Pre-flip the dependent's base back to `main` BEFORE merging the
   predecessor.** This keeps B open through the predecessor's merge.
   B will go `DIRTY` (because its history still contains A's pre-squash
   commit, and `main` now has the squashed version), so a fresh rebase
   is still needed before B can merge — but B stays open and you can
   force-push to the same branch.
2. **Drop the predecessor's pre-squash commit with `--onto`** when
   rebasing B against the new `main`:
   ```
   git rebase --onto origin/main <predecessor-pre-squash-sha>
   ```
   This is the cleanest way to re-base B; a plain `git rebase main`
   leaves the duplicate commit floating and produces conflicts against
   the squashed version on `main`.

If you forget step 1 and the dependent gets auto-closed, recovery is to
force-push the rebased branch and `gh pr create` a fresh PR (the closed
one cannot be reopened once its base ref is gone).

Origin: 2026-05-03 merge train. PR #162 (stacked on #159) was
auto-closed when #159's `--delete-branch` removed
`claude/issue-122-cron-runs`; recovered as PR #172. PR #163 (stacked on
#161) was pre-flipped to `main` ahead of #161's merge, then rebased
with `--onto origin/main 2c0e680` to drop the duplicated #149 commit
cleanly. Both landed without losing CI history.
