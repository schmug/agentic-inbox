/**
 * Org-wide settings stored at R2 key `org/settings.json` (#106).
 *
 * Mirrors `MailboxSettings` minus the strictly-per-mailbox fields
 * (`fromName`, `signature`, `forwarding`, `autoReply`) and adds the three
 * security-critical model fields that are intentionally org-only at the v1
 * tier (`injectionScannerModel`, `draftVerifierModel`, `classifierModel`).
 *
 * All top-level fields are optional. The resolver treats absence as "inherit
 * the next layer down" (system default at the org tier). Nested objects
 * (`security`, `intel.hub`, `intel.feeds`) are replaced whole — never
 * deep-merged — so an org override carries the entire object including
 * arrays. Per-array extend semantics for allowlists are tracked as a
 * follow-up.
 *
 * Multi-tenant note: today this lives at the flat key `org/settings.json`
 * (single-org-per-deploy, matching #104). The R2 key is centralised in
 * `workers/lib/org-settings.ts` (`orgSettingsKey()`) so a future
 * multi-tenant refactor is one helper change rather than a cross-cutting
 * grep.
